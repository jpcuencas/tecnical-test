### Running app

There is a docker-compose.yml file with the configuration needed.
So you only have to run up de docker-compose with:

```bash
 docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

This `docker-compose.yml` file needs several environment variables that must be provided via `.env` file.
